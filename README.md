# Portfolio
## Overview
Nick Sofianakos' personal portfolio website. Essentially, this website contains my resume, accomplishments, work experience, projects I have done, and much more! Despite streamlit being used primarily as an easy to deploy web application for dashboarding by AI/ML Engineers, it functions and capabilities make it a viable option to use for a personal website. 

With the convenience of using Python as a beginner-friendly programming language, I have now decided to evolve this personal project into a time capsule - documenting key moments and achievements that I have attained since commencing my formal education at 7 years old. In addition, should I be successful in completing this project, I intend to provide my codes as open-source, so that other students can document their educational journey in a similar manner. My only request would be for other users to provide credit to this repository, especially if the end template is very similar to the end-product of this web application.

Portfolio website developed using `Python`, `HTML` and `CSS` - deployed using Streamlit Cloud
